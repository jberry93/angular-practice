# Angular Service

Let's walk through the code in this [article][1]

First off:
- What is a service in Angular?
  - [According to the article][1], "A service provides an easy way for us to share data and functionality throughout an app"
  - [According to the Angular documentation][2], the factory method will instantiate a *service factory* which takes in 2 arguments:
    - 1) Name of the service
    - 2) Function containing the logic of the service
